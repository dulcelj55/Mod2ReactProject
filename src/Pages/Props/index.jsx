    In React, "props" (short for properties) is a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.  They allow you to make React components dynamic and resusavle by configuring their behavior and apperance based on data they receive.  
    props can be passed (props) or ({count})
    // key value pairs 
    // are read only
    // take varibles and give them to the children
    // props can be passed as one variable  (destructure) or the total object
    </div>
  )
}

export default Props
