      {/* <p> React is a JavaScript library tool that has several characteristics of a framework. Created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta (Facebook) in 2011, it builds user interfaces based on components. In other words, React is made up of components that act as elements that will be compiled into an HTML file using JSX. Browsers cannot read JSX, thus the need for translation into HTML. When using React, several libraries need to be installed. Once installed, they need to be imported, so you'll see:
      {<br/>}
      use an image?
      
       </p>
        <br/>import {"a tool"} from "that tool's library"

        {<br/>}
        <p>
       The newest way of {creating an app} navigate('startUp') can be found using Vite. 
       Some previous knowledge is needed when using React including: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some skills to revisit include .map, tinary functions, and spread operators.
       Because React uses JSX here are some things to note:
       the component is split between JavaScript (above the return statement) and JSX anything in the return statement. If using JavaScript in the lower half you will need to use curly brackets.
       when using class, JSX requires className 
       instead
       the way to comment out code looks like this: example of comment
       </p>
       

      
       In React there are mulitple CSS files.  Index.css is the main file that will effect the whole project, ie border box.  App.css will only design what's in the App.jsx folder. Example could be a grid layout.
       Other index.css files are tied to the Componenets and only influence those components.  */}
